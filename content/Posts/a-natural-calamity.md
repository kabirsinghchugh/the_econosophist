<p>I have a tendency of having some really odd dreams, which I never knew how to make sense of, so after a particularly cryptic dream today, I quickly grabbed some pen and paper and jotted a poem out of it, which still doesn&#8217;t make sense to me, but might do so for you. Our unconscious thoughts are extremely powerful, and we can&#8217;t take them lightly I feel, So I feel it would do no harm if I just convert the dream to a poem. Do tell what you make of it.</p>

<h1>A NATURAL CALAMITY</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>Gazed into the morning sky,<br />
A pulp of Golden Orange Green;</p>
<p>The Giant Ape leapt to the nigh,<br />
Clutching the eagle by its beak;</em></strong><strong><em></p>
<p>A riot of monkeys erupted surprise,<br />
A fear of strength they scattered through;<br />
For hurled back I into the night,<br />
puzzling at this grave misfortune;</p>
<p>Tethered myself I doth heard,<br />
The Great Fire burnt the forest down;<br />
An ash of golden orange green, they said,<br />
&#8216;The sky is dead&#8217;, O I renounced;</p>
<p>Darted back I to the stream,<br />
A new hope hoped the heart anew;<br />
Alas the ape caged by ape I saw,<br />
Caged the grin of thy insanity;</em></strong></h2>
