<p>After careful introspection, I have come to the belief that educated folks like us, who have developed tools of skepticism and cynicism and think we are beyond the forces of propaganda today are the biggest and most vulnerable victims of it. This is because we misinterpret how propaganda on us actually works, which takes advantage of our awareness, let me illustrate how we fall prey to propaganda.</p>
<p>Propaganda works by making us believe in nothing.</p>
<p>Propaganda works on some sections of the society by mere rhetoric but works on us by alienating ourselves through the ridiculousness of that rhetoric.</p>
<p>When we see preposterous links, which we arrogantly dismiss as which fool would succumb to this, are deliberately preposterous. It works by making us feel neutral from all sorts of news, maybe cynical or skeptical or entirely apolitical. There can be two examples for this.</p>
<p>A.Memes- Yes, the dangerous power of memes. We see memes which are deliberate trolls, harmless pieces of humor but we miss the psychological impact of them. A meme can bring out a highly sensitive issue and make a joke out of it, from communism to Nazism to even India&#8217;s shitting problem or simply &#8216;remove kebab&#8217; highlighted. This enters our subconscious where we attribute a revolting thought slowly into a humorous analogy, ultimately we miss out on the revolting aspect at all and label such things funny. Things like 9/11 being a conspiracy, even the election of Donald Trump distort the negative heuristic associated with them, and we understate the importance of the issue for a few mere laughs.</p>
<p>B. All news is agenda- When we are consistently barraged with &#8216;fake news&#8217; it is overtly explicit such that we lose faith in all news. If the rhetoric from one side says, this news is fake, we view all news with the lens with a skepticism of maybe this attack IS based on an agenda, an ideological agenda. This is NOT good skepticism because we don&#8217;t have the time and resources to check the validity of all news that we read, that the easiest option becomes to disregard all news together. This fits perfectly with the first side since they now become equals in an ideological battle in the form of select side A or B when one side has made a critical attack while the other has used mere rhetoric. IT IS NOT EQUAL AT ALL!</p>
<p>Taking refuge in the cynicism of all media is the wrong kind of skepticism.</p>
<p>For the ones making preposterous claims, a calculated reply is moot because for them it&#8217;s a game, for which if no facts are produced, the reply itself is a meme or labels of being a keyboard SJW(social justice warrior).</p>
<p>Not every critique is political in nature. Not every critique has vested interests. Read the stuff before you judge for yourself even if you can&#8217;t validate them. But perceiving an article to be agenda driven before reading it erodes all value out of it, and just reinforces your bias towards them, or worse, cynicism.</p>
