# Basic Presentation Points

## Introduction

### What I want to show

1. In a location model
2. There is a compounding such that low quality seller chooses the poor location, and has incentives to put even lower effort than he would if he were in high location.

---

### Hypothesis

1. \(D_{l}\) chooses \(Y_{p}\) and \(D_{h}\) chooses \(Y_{r}\)
2. The Incompetent seller \(D_{l}\) chooses lower effort in \(Y_{p}\) than would in \(Y_{r}\)

---

## Basic Framework

1. Circular city model with segments which represent asymmetric moving costs \(\delta_{r}\) and \(\delta_{p}\) such that \[\delta_{r}<\delta_{p}\]
2. For \(J\) doctors \(J\) circumference such that segments of unit length each. Simultaneous location choice.

---

### Assumptions

1. It is normally assumed that prtivate sector provides higher quality with higher prices, but this is not necessarily the case.(Das and Hammer)

### Expert Types

### Competence

### Effort

### Discussion

## Consumers

Mass of Consumers of types _uniformly distributed_ in the circular city with differential moving costs according to types. Thus:

> \(R\) and \(P\) types with \(\delta_{R}\) and \(\delta_{P}\) moving costs.

---

### Consumer types

* Sophisticated/Naive as a function of segments or with differential moving costs?
* Rich/Poor

---

## Consumer's Utility Functions

1. Utility function \(u\) where \(v\) is reservation utility, \(z\) as distance travelled, \(\omega\) as state, and \(\theta\) as type such that \[u(v,z,\omega,c) =\]

---

### Doubts

1. Consumer's decision to visit or not visit and its importance.
2. Population proportion \(f\) and \(1-f\)
3. Single peakedness in utility such that indifferent consumer condition applicable. Monotonic ordering on types \[\theta_{1}<\theta_{2}<\theta_{3}\cdots<\theta_{N}\] for N types.

---

## Information and States

### Information

1. \(\omega \in [0,1]\) where thresholds \(\{C,E\}\) such that \(0< C < E <1\) where \(C\) is cheap(Easy) and \(E\) is Expensive(complex)
2. 

---

### Location

1. Doctor's location as a signal of quality

---

### Discussion

* Should 0 utilization be allowed for any seller or positive demand? What difference will it make?
