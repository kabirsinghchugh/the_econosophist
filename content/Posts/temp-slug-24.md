<h1>Evolution Creatice by Henri Bergson</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1: Evolving Life, Mechanism and Teleology</h2>
<p>We are the ones with knowledge of our own existence. We are in various states in a multiplicity of composite sensations, feelings, ideas &#8211; We give some definiteness to such states, a block sequence sort of, <span class="math">\[s_{1},s_{2},s_{3}, \cdots s_{N}\]</span><br />
Within each state, no moment is the same, so that we have a sequence of moments for each state <span class="math">\[s_{11},s_{12},s_{13}, \cdots s_{1k}\forall s_{i}\]</span></p>
<p>Say I am focusing on an external object for an extended period of time. Then, the only parameter of change is the time. Then in this continuity, it is us that impute discontinuity as an act of separation. A change that is catches our attention whilst focusing, and the awareness of the state itself induces a new state. Our memory is associated with these points of discontinuities off a continuous whole. Then off these discontinuous points, we again abstract a continuity through the ego consciousness.</p>
<blockquote><p>Say we have a necklace of pearls with different colours. But in Reality they are a gradient where it becomes imperceptible as to when one colour ends and the next begins, so we demarcate boundaries and specify a colour for each section, that is, a pearl. The color then imputed is done so psychically. It is through the difference of colours we recognize the discreteness, otherwise if it were a single one, it would be no different from the gradient that is a continuous thread.</p></blockquote>
<p>The above example is how Time is perceived. Since the present is a point which as soon realized becomes past, and we cannot catch the present, we make sense of time via <strong>duration</strong> aka <em>local memory</em>. Thus there are two ways of preserving the past, where one is like a hard-disk, of long term memories, the other is of duration, more like RAM, to make sense of the <strong>now</strong>. As it is obvious, we can&#8217;t exactly relive a single moment since every moment is uniquely indexed.</p>
<p>Each moment thus contains the possibilities which branch out to the next node, an <em>instantaneous creation</em>. A puzzle is posed by Bergson as follows :-</p>
<blockquote><p>Can an artist visualize a completed work before it has begun? And if he can, does that mean that work exists before existing?</p>
<p>Sometimes we don&#8217;t obviously notice that each moment is unique(apart from time), but a block of solid object is undergoing changes at the molecular level.</p>
<p>A hydra has seven heads, then is it one hydra with seven heads or seven hydras with one body? Where in lies the identity? <span class="math">\[x = \frac{x}{7} .7\]</span></p></blockquote>
<p>We are organisms, not mechanisms.</p>
