One does not hear the words _rationality/logic_ and _mysticism/spirituality_ together but in negation of each other, let alone as a single clause. Is it as contradictory as to say - _the fat anorexic_? Well, no. It turns out that mysticism is compatible with rational thought, but in a way that the _eyes perceive all except themselves_, or the _teeth that bite themselves_ - in short, **as the limiting point of a singularity** which can only be intuited, and not known.

Wittgenstein's 75 page work, The _Tractatus Logico Philosophicus_(**TLP** now onward) tackles the fundamental concerns of philosophy, ranging from our perception of reality to ethical questions; from logic and language to mathematics and the mystical - _all in a nested framework of seven propositions._

Wittgenstein's TLP is an enigmatic work. _It is a book which is self aware_, and contains within it layers of meaning, depending on the intention of the reader - the logician can benefit from it as much as a priest, and thus - _it serves as a genuine work of philosophy, in its actual scope_ - which is simply the result of humanity's self consciousness and the questions it raises - _God becomes as much as a relevant concept as logic or ethics_.

Indeed, the TLP was simultaneously an emblem for the logical positivists - who argued that _all thoughts beyond the fundamental natural sciences are meaningless_ to thinkers such as Alan Watts and even Osho, for whom it represented the most lucid and _straightforward approach to the doors of enlightenment_.

The way I see the TLP is as **a Zen koan**( _A zen koan is a tool used by Zen masters where the student must solve a riddle which is senseless, so that in solving it, one reaches **Kensho** - the sudden realization or simply enlightenment_).  At its deepest -  the **TLP is one large koan**, that is, **it is self-contradictory by design**, and is **edifying exactly in its self aware contradiction** - As Wittgenstein cautions us in the penultimate proposition of TLP:-

> My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understandsme finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (H**e must so to speak throwaway the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.**)He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly. - 6.54

For those who really devote their time and minds to this small but densely cryptic book, they would realize eventually that the seventh proposition, the conclusion of the work serves as a direct contradiction to the first proposition, rendering the whole of TLP as senseless, but from a lower equilibrium of senselessness to a higher one - just as there is the same musical note octaves apart - rendering them the same but not really the same either.[[1]]

> **The World is All that is the Case** - Prop. 1

> **Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.** - Prop. 7

The entire goal of the TLP is to go through the locus of propositions, and realize that one is not traversing a linear path, but an _ouroboros_( a serpent which eats its own tail). The next section delves into my interpretation of the TLP.

## TLP - Analysis

### Preliminaries

Wittgenstein starts the TLP as a classic work of metaphysics and ontology - (Of questions relating to reality and existence) through the instruments of logic and language, to disprove their existence as fields of study by its own methodology.

**The strategy is thus** - _There is a **R**eality and a reality where_

â€‹														$$reality=f(Reality)$$

To make sense of **R**eality(and consequently - reality) we need a unit of measurement, a sort of currency of making reality explicit. Indeed, we all use a unit of ontology without ever questioning the fact that one can perceive Reality using various _axes_ of cognition.

The manifold world outside human cognition is not dealt with, and is granted the label of _substance_ - take it as atom, energy, or whatever you want. It is human cognition that cognizes _substance_ in ontological units - the default unit being objects.[[2]] That is, the World is made up of objects. Thus this is the metaphysical point of departure in Modern Metaphysics, ever since Immanuel Kant dismissed the _object outside human cognition as fundamentally unknowable_ because our **mind cognizes the manifold as objects in space, time and causal relations, which are not distinct absolute realities, rather the forms of intuition, or more accurately, the conditions which make sense objects intuitable in the first place.**

Wittgenstein here introduces a radical concept. While after Kant, there arose alternatives to _object-oriented-ontology_, such as _Event-ontology_(events as the unit of reality) or _Process-Metaphysics_(Processes as unit of reality), Wittgenstein incorporated two units of ontology **coexisting simultaneously but independently of each other** (_think quantum theory where light is both a particle and a wave_).

> These two fundamental units of Reality(once removed from the manifold) are composed of Facts and Objects.

One can see **R**eality in terms of **F**acts (I'll explain what they are in detail, but a close analogy for now are _events_) **OR** Objects.

reality(not to be confused with **R**eality) is a function of **R**eality and thus _twice removed from the manifold_. _**reality**_ is the structure/model of Reality (which is our raw data) and  _contains its ontological units as functions of Facts and Objects, as **Propositions** and **Names** respectively_.

As one can guess, what Wittgenstein is getting to is that _**R**eality is mirrored/modelled as reality through language._

That is to say - _**Language mirrors Reality**_ - the consequence of which is that if we can analyze language through its _syntax/grammar_ and _semantics/meaning_, we can analyze **R**eality. To Summarize,

> $$Names = f(Objects)$$

> $$Propositions = f(Facts)$$

> $$Language = f(Reality)$$

Now here things become interesting - `so I suggest that absorb the basics and pre-requisites now and only proceed when you are comfortable with what has been written up till now.`

### Core Analysis

Wittgenstein is serious when he proclaims the independence of Facts and Objects. The independence stems from the following reasoning

> Objects are named. Facts are asserted. Therefore one **cannot assert an object and cannot name Facts.**

Facts are composite units made up of individual atomic units which are indivisible - Wittgenstein calls these units as the _atomic fact_(hereafter fact compared to the composite **F**act). The assertion of facts imputes a _truth_ value to facts and thus propositions.

> For example - the fact is that there is a chessboard in my room which can be asserted via the proposition

> _There is a chessboard in my room_ - T/F [atomic fact]

Objects and thus names are devoid of any truth-value/meaning/sense on their own apart from denotation.

> For example - _tree_ denotes the object but is meaningless in isolation in all aspects but its reference - _that is the meaning of a name is in the object it refers to_

So how are these two modes of Reality(reality) consistent in the single manifold? It is through the relation between facts and objects.

> **Facts are combinations of objects**[[3]]

So what can we infer from the aforementioned axioms and definitions?

> The atomic fact is the simplest possible fact. An object is not a fact. facts are combination of objects.

Thus there need to be at least two objects to constitute a fact.

The simplest possible fact(the atomic fact) deals with the fact of existence only. That is the atomic fact only contains of existential propositions, and if not then it would be a composite i.e. a Fact.

For example - **There (exists) is a chessboard(o_1) in my room(o_2)** or

$$\exists f = o_{1}o_{2} - True/False$$

Thus the set of all objects gives me the set of all possible facts and thus the set of all possible Facts. That is

* $$o_i\in O\implies \Phi =(o_{i}o_{j}o_{k}\cdots): i\neq j\neq k\cdots \& F\in \Phi$$
* The set of all possible Facts determines the actual state of affairs in the world. That is facts determine the state of affairs - whether something is the case or not the case(The case is the existence of the fact that is a fact = T).Therefore
* All that is the case forms the world.
* facts in logical space(possible facts from given objects) _constitute_ the world.
* Reality is the union of existence and non-existence of atomic facts
* $$R \equiv \cup([f:f=T].[f':f=F)$$ or $$\cup(f.f')$$

As a preliminary, I will conclude the first part here. In the next part we will delve into the structure of language - syntax and semantics to analyze how we cognize relations in Reality projected from relations in reality/language and what it tells about us and the world. Thus we move into the realm of language first to capture Reality unlike this part where we mirrored a language from the realm of Reality - facts and objects. That is our main unit of analysis would now be _Propositions_ from which we shall derive relations between

* propositions and thoughts
* propositions and images/pictures
* signs and symbols in language
* Natural language(empirical language) vs Logical language(language as a model of world)

It is to be mentioned that the first and last propositions are also the most quotable and quoted propositions of the entire work - and that is no coincidence. [â†©ï¸Ž]

in philosophical circles known as _Cartesian Dualism_ between mind and matter i.e. Subject and Object - The core structure of our natural languages. [â†©ï¸Ž]

Think of it like this - facts are _relativistic_ - a black ink mark on its own is an abstraction unless it is in a canvas/floor/paper. Due to our use of natural language, we forget that fact are always contextual and embedded in relation to something - _I exist_ here it is understood that we have omitted the second object which is present in the form _I exist(in the world)_ . Interestingly that is why it will be senseless to say _This song is beautiful_ - because though there are two objects apparently, a particular song and the class of beautiful songs - the former is an object of substance, while the latter is not an object, unless it is the name of the song - _beautiful by abc_  [â†©ï¸Ž]
