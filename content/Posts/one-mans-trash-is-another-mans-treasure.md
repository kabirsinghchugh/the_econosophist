<p>When viewed from one perspective, the title reflects banality of the highest order. On poverty, I can belabour the obvious or I can take this opportunity to address this issue with utmost clarity. I was once beleaguered by the vernacular once I was roaming the state, all coming forth and blasting me with their issues. My answers belied my guilt and I was bereaved of my conscience.</p>
<p>From being a blithe, bucolic adolescent, how come I ended up being a burlesque image of my former self?</p>
<p>All the contrived attempts at being my former self proved to be highly vitriolic. Though it was through my own volition, the thoughts vitiated my brain and I felt disgusted. Some poetically framed them as the vicissitudes of life though such verbose excuses hardly ever placate me.</p>
<p>My reality was now a verisimilitude version of my former life. But I would again be belying my thoughts if I can’t accede that there was an unctuous touch to them.</p>
<p>Such metamorphosis has resulted in a guile version of me.  But it was not my fault I cried over and again. Such hackneyed attempts and self gloating only proved to be histrionic and a gross hyperbole.</p>
<p>I was now juxtaposed with two versions of myself. Overlapping or distinct I didn’t know. Each found the other noxious while I was obsequious to their whims. My ostensible silence belied my fear.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that my thinking was facile but rather had a quixotic flavour to it. But is it too much to ask from people whose sympathies dry out at self wincing facetious cries? I could only dream the universe had more alacrity to proceed and exonerate me through some mystic ablutions. Perhaps too sanguine, if there is such a thing.</p>
<p>Finally I cleared up and avowed my problems and identified the artifices my mind was playing with me. I identified also the apocryphal nature of my thoughts which were supplanted by fear than original thought. I decided it was time to act, and the foremost attempt was abnegation of all forms of self pity. I applied all my mental faculties into the abstruse nature of my problem and with due efforts, my mind acquiesced.</p>
<p>After overcoming the lion’s share of my problem, my mind was still ambivalent and proved to be an antecedent for the oncoming anxiety. When it finally struck, I was prepared and thought of it as an anachronism. I transformed myself from a dilettante and established a resistance, which ended up being the bulwark of my fight against such decadent thinking. Sorry if I bothered you too much. This was an exercise at desultory writing. Hope I enjoyed and learnt as well.</p>
