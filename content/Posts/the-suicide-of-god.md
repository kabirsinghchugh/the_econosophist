<h2>I &#8211; The Day of God</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>T’was a sunny Sunday morning,</p>
<p>The warm light permeated the bones;</p>
<p>The winds made music with trees and when,</p>
<p>The first screams were heard at noon;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bodan, the town where God resided,</p>
<p>In heart of every woman, child, and man;</p>
<p>Loved they life, nature, and God as one,</p>
<p>Until God played them with a godly prank;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The children played, the elder waved,</p>
<p>Beautiful morning for Mass it was;</p>
<p>And did every Bodan sang with heart,</p>
<p>For it was special for them and special for God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For God is this and God is that we say,</p>
<p>God exists or God is Man;</p>
<p>God is nature, spirit or cosmos we hail;</p>
<p>Yet that day they didn’t foresee God’s plan;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sun bled red and the sky rumbled,</p>
<p>A locust of brown gas enshrined Bodan;</p>
<p><em>Mercy!</em> Bodan begged in song,</p>
<p>To no heed their cries availed;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For God is not human, is he?</p>
<p>Better be not for what we are;</p>
<p>A swift, painless exit and a seat beside him,</p>
<p>Wasn’t it our prayers answered at last?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as to the dust, did a stampede add,</p>
<p>As God slowly declared his plans;</p>
<p>Dug their nails to mother’s breast,</p>
<p>As the children did,</p>
<p><strong>Fade to Black.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Life is Suffering, my children you doth know,</em></p>
<p><em>And a gift of my existence did I bestow!</em></p>
<p><em>But thy sins though forgiven, forbid me,</em></p>
<p><em>From giving thee a place with thy progeny,</em></p>
<p><em>In the eternal truth of heaven;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>‘I hath hit two birds with one stone’, rejoiced God,</em></p>
<p><em>Nay three, with the innocent in heaven;</em></p>
<p><em>And to let them be known of their father as well,</em></p>
<p><em>To test their faith through this ingenious method.</em></p>
<p>And so did God command the children’s souls to Heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>II – The Return of Man or lack thereof</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brownness thus disappeared, no trace but a golden hue,</p>
<p>Clean as cleanliness could be, godliness was there they now knew;</p>
<p>The children’s pale faces did smile, in a body but devoid of any life;</p>
<p>‘<em>Wake up</em>!’ gently sang the mothers, yet not a single voice could come through;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the tears rolled by and throats went dry, it suddenly dawned anew,</p>
<p>It was but God’s gift, his mercy, his plan, his to take and his to provide;</p>
<p>God and man’s wrath did know no bounds, until did they see a grieving mother;</p>
<p>For then did men see, that murder, crimes of flesh, is but petty,</p>
<p>That true blackness, of something even God might fear, lies in a mother’s eyes beside her dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the men finally realized that God’s joke was so clear,</p>
<p><em>Have we not bowed at nature’s wrath?</em></p>
<p><em>But only standing afar did we,</em></p>
<p><em>That God’s jokes hath made us laugh;</em></p>
<p><em>But now that the honor of being audience to the joke was ours,</em></p>
<p><em>The only laughter we heareth is silence;</em></p>
<h2> III – The Song of God</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The silence slowly broke in voices,</p>
<p>First one and two then three and four;</p>
<p>Till the wailing reached God’s own ears,</p>
<p><em>‘Whether the subject or object am I?’</em> did he wonder</p>
<p><em>Their imperfect language doesn’t make it clear!</em>;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The betrayal by God was the message he didn’t hear,</p>
<p>Or did he but he didn’t care?</p>
<p>Because the women did unite hand in hand now,</p>
<p>In one final song of reverence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the innocent bodies were picked up and cremated,</p>
<p>The men to fulfill God’s unusual wishes,</p>
<p><em>Is there a reason? Should we fear, love, hate that one,</em></p>
<p><em>Can we ever question him?</em> They couldn’t ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But no such question arose in the mothers’ hearts,</p>
<p>Now they were resolute, their child to them is more than a god,</p>
<p>This our creator did not assume.</p>
<p>The eerie beautiful summer Sunday, clear now from the brown gas,</p>
<p>Now covered in black the sky was the smoke of the children’s ash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> IV &#8211; Redemption</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Song was a passion of God’s suffering, with the intensity of antiquity,</p>
<p>What was not antique being a new technique, The song of the ritual sacrifice;</p>
<p>‘<em>Oh, A song for their blessed children!</em>’, God said of this new development,</p>
<p>Yet God knows all but he didn’t know thus, for he was the song’s tribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There grew a sinister strength, as the women and men united in song,</p>
<p>They mocked God now, naughty children of their father;</p>
<p>For the punishment for the deed they had already accrued,</p>
<p>The mocking song grew louder in cruel laughter,</p>
<p>Crying or laughing or both together? And thus God now got the inkling,</p>
<p>Of something to come now, ‘<em>The Horror!</em>’ said he, quivering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The defiance in prayer now stood at contrast, with laughing</p>
<p>God thundered, ‘<em>How dare they</em>?’,</p>
<p>But eyes wide open, they stared into his heart,</p>
<p>‘<em>Fools! Don’t they know their place?’</em>;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the Funeral song started,</p>
<p><em>‘Oh! The blasphemy! The Murder of God they intend!’</em>;</p>
<p><em>‘Burn this holy ground with their skins would they!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Teach them burning I shall for eternity!’</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The song now in its final stages stretched,</p>
<p>Hesitancy, struggle, but no stoppage yet;</p>
<p>The struggle made the beauty sublime,</p>
<p>A beautiful song of the dead;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the breath and heart lose their timber,</p>
<p>As tapered the final stretch;</p>
<p>Slower and slower and slower still,</p>
<p>When God found out the game thus planned;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Does God have Free Will?</em> We ask,</p>
<p><em>‘Then why is the world the way it is?’</em></p>
<p><em>Do the choices he maketh the world better,</em></p>
<p><em>How possible if the world starts in perfect?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer now we know as did they,</p>
<p>They, who forced God to play his hand;</p>
<p>Man’s Will overpowered him, and joined the song did he,</p>
<p>Of the folly of his actions, for his own children did not know he.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God can never lose, this fact is absolute.</p>
<p>But in winning this game he lost to Mankind</p>
<p>As they slowly fell to victory, and as the song petered out at last,</p>
<p>Collapsed they did, enveloped by whiteness;</p>
<p><strong>Fade to White.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">PostScript</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In heaven find their children and play, in fields of pearly heavenly white,</p>
<p>Yet God came and smiled as they smiled, below an empty church stood still;</p>
<p>No one to pray and no one to sing, such an emptiness was this,</p>
<p>But God is true emptiness and emptiness is God, is the sage wisdom, and with this,</p>
<p>God committed suicide and played with his children.</p>
