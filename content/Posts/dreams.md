<p>I don&#8217;t know what it is with me when there are days I can&#8217;t think of a single word to communicate, to days like today, when I churn out a poem in minutes! Anyway, this one is hazy, I don&#8217;t think I intended to express a specific meaning, though what came out is instantaneously meaningful to me- hope it arises some strange thoughts in you too which I can&#8217;t express without playing with words.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">1<br />
Echoes of laughter delayed,<br />
Spraying in this saccharine dismay;<br />
Beasts adorning manly suits,<br />
Sniffed off me the stench of truth;<br />
Enveloping walls suffocate me,<br />
In salty breeze and cold despair,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">O, God of Heat and Light!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">seeing thee with thine own eyes,  <span style="color:var(--color-text);">Eternal One!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This sublime dull yellow,<br />
Richer than rainbows infinite,<br />
The world in its yellowness,<br />
Alarm, beauty and resting peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">2<br />
Suddenly opened eyes to a field yellow,<br />
‘Was I dreaming’ asking the nearby fellow;<br />
‘Neither that nor this’ &#8211; This is reality,<br />
said he who resembled myself to me.<br />
Feel I’ve wandered here for ages,<br />
Though born today I was,<br />
Familiar faceless smiles around me, I stand<br />
Feet on ground like an oak tree proud,<br />
It was then that time stopped still,<br />
A superman arose among men, two legs less than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">3<br />
Flowers giveth and taketh from the bee,<br />
busy in its buzzing work,<br />
Why am I just still? Labour and behold,<br />
Killed bees a dozen three, honey of my labor!<br />
That’s the meaning my fellow dreamers<br />
This, I do not conceal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">4<br />
Running far across the field,<br />
Bumped to a merry seed, For he,<br />
then praised me for my sleep, &#8216;Nay!&#8217;<br />
Said I, &#8217;tis just a dream!&#8217; Smiling, he cried</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Neither slept I<br />
Neither dreamt I, neither awaketh I<br />
Who are you? I asked</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8216;Neither I, Am I&#8217; &#8211; vanished<br />
I farewelled my teacher with a bow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">5</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Boring ants! Shifted my gaze,<br />
To the stars above in infinite haze,<br />
Paintings of empty darkness, the void<br />
Reminded me of my blissful sleep,<br />
Prior to this vulgar shattering of a dream,<br />
The real heavens where birds fly,<br />
Is one where I am the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">6<br />
Legs don’t fit a disobedient mind,<br />
Always running after nature’s cry,<br />
Squirrels, Sparrows, Tree and Yarrows,<br />
What is an hour, a year, days a hundred to them?<br />
Today they experienced me for minutes a few,<br />
Only if what minutes were they knew,<br />
Strange creatures, some of us have work to do!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">7<br />
Napping in this blissful shade,<br />
chided was I, to learn the work and ways,<br />
‘Working now, Hush!’, I said,<br />
Will play games tomorrow my friend,<br />
Bowing, I went back to work.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">8.<br />
As I  saw the children running,<br />
My tired legs, and the sun setting,<br />
My heart yearning I realized,<br />
That I am but the eternal child,<br />
As my weary legs stood again in two,<br />
The sun blazed as a Sunday Noon,<br />
The Child ran with the children,<br />
They laughed &#8211; who? Immature children!<br />
Calling themselves adults knowing nature true,<br />
Blind to little gods eternal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">9<br />
Lovers embrace, This and I,<br />
As I depart, as we do</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">when spring turns to fall,<br />
Yet I say farewell not with a heavy heart,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">You see<br />
I am not going either too long or far,<br />
Will see you again a thousand years,<br />
And for a thousand lives, I’ll have to suffer thee.<br />
Till then, let this be heard in tune-<br />
I’ll be right here, just without me and you.</p>
