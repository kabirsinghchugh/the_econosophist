<p>Writing an essay is something which scares the heejeebies of the average person. It&#8217;s an exercise not so much in writing, but in  organizational skills. And for people like me who are impulsive, scatter brained, attention deficited or simply who think as they write, it can be a frightening experience.</p>
<p>The true artists of the game transcend the rules and develop their own style. This requires a lot of creativity, a strong command over the language, and a wee bit of natural language skills. Basically like an art, the good become better at it, while the best write poetry on canvas. However for lesser mortals like us, we can learn the science of essay writing, which is mainstay of this article.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that even the talented lot of people would struggle in planning their essay which require more than an hour of writing(Around 2500 words) and usually within a pressure or time constrained environment. However with decent analytical tools and a fairly good background reading, there exists a scientific algorithm which can produce not just a decent, but rather an essay which can compete with the prodiguous ones.</p>
<p>If you think the algorithm of an essay is the simple introduction, body, and conclusion where the conclusion is basically a plagiarism of the introduction; Leave now. You&#8217;re dead to me. The thing is, the science of essay writing as somewhat a more complicated model, where you cannot just expand on a few arguments you have and seek to complete the word limit.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s begin. <strong>( I advise you to memorize the structure by heart, which will save a lot of time during an examination.</strong></p>
<p>An essay is an exercise in written debate. You introduce the topic, formulate your hypothesis, break down the topic analytically through your tools, hence give your argument and conclude your findings. Just like an exercise in scientific research.</p>
