Is it as contradictory as to say - the fat anorexic? Well, no. It turns out that mysticism is compatible with rational thought, but in a way that the eyes perceive all except themselves, or the teeth that bite themselves - in short, as the limiting point of a singularity which can only be intuited, and not known.\nWittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s 75 page work, The Tractatus Logico Philosophicus(TLP now onward) tackles the fundamental concerns of philosophy, ranging from our perception of reality to ethical questions; from logic and language to mathematics and the mystical - all in a nested framework of seven propositions.\nWittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s TLP is an enigmatic work. It is a book which is self aware, and contains within it layers of meaning, depending on the intention of the reader - the logician can benefit from it as much as a priest, and thus - it serves as a genuine work of philosophy, in its actual scope - which is simply the result of humanity\u0026rsquo;s self consciousness and the questions it raises - God becomes as much as a relevant concept as logic or ethics.\nIndeed, the TLP was simultaneously an emblem for the logical positivists - who argued that all thoughts beyond the fundamental natural sciences are meaningless to thinkers such as Alan Watts and even Osho, for whom it represented the most lucid and straightforward approach to the doors of enlightenment.\nThe way I see the TLP is as a Zen koan( A zen koan is a tool used by Zen masters where the student must solve a riddle which is senseless, so that in solving it, one reaches Kensho - the sudden realization or simply enlightenment). At its deepest - the TLP is one large koan, that is, it is self-contradictory by design, and is edifying exactly in its self aware contradiction - As Wittgenstein cautions us in the penultimate proposition of TLP:-\n My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understandsme finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throwaway the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly. - 6.54\n For those who really devote their time and minds to this small but densely cryptic book, they would realize eventually that the seventh proposition, the conclusion of the work serves as a direct contradiction to the first proposition, rendering the whole of TLP as senseless, but from a lower equilibrium of senselessness to a higher one - just as there is the same musical note octaves apart - rendering them the same but not really the same either.[[1]]\n The World is All that is the Case - Prop. 1\n  Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. - Prop. 7\n The entire goal of the TLP is to go through the locus of propositions, and realize that one is not traversing a linear path, but an ouroboros( a serpent which eats its own tail). The next section delves into my interpretation of the TLP.\n Ouroboros   TLP - Analysis Preliminaries Wittgenstein starts the TLP as a classic work of metaphysics and ontology - (Of questions relating to reality and existence) through the instruments of logic and language, to disprove their existence as fields of study by its own methodology.\nThe strategy is thus - There is a Reality and a reality where\n​\t$$reality=f(Reality)$$\nTo make sense of Reality(and consequently - reality) we need a unit of measurement, a sort of currency of making reality explicit. Indeed, we all use a unit of ontology without ever questioning the fact that one can perceive Reality using various axes of cognition.\nThe manifold world outside human cognition is not dealt with, and is granted the label of substance - take it as atom, energy, or whatever you want. It is human cognition that cognizes substance in ontological units - the default unit being objects.[[2]] That is, the World is made up of objects. Thus this is the metaphysical point of departure in Modern Metaphysics, ever since Immanuel Kant dismissed the object outside human cognition as fundamentally unknowable because our mind cognizes the manifold as objects in space, time and causal relations, which are not distinct absolute realities, rather the forms of intuition, or more accurately, the conditions which make sense objects intuitable in the first place.\nWittgenstein here introduces a radical concept. While after Kant, there arose alternatives to object-oriented-ontology, such as Event-ontology(events as the unit of reality) or Process-Metaphysics(Processes as unit of reality), Wittgenstein incorporated two units of ontology coexisting simultaneously but independently of each other (think quantum theory where light is both a particle and a wave).\n These two fundamental units of Reality(once removed from the manifold) are composed of Facts and Objects.\n One can see Reality in terms of Facts (I\u0026rsquo;ll explain what they are in detail, but a close analogy for now are events) OR Objects.\nreality(not to be confused with Reality) is a function of Reality and thus twice removed from the manifold. reality is the structure/model of Reality (which is our raw data) and contains its ontological units as functions of Facts and Objects, as Propositions and Names respectively.\nAs one can guess, what Wittgenstein is getting to is that Reality is mirrored/modelled as reality through language.\nThat is to say - Language mirrors Reality - the consequence of which is that if we can analyze language through its syntax/grammar and semantics/meaning, we can analyze Reality. To Summarize,\n $$Names = f(Objects)$$\n  $$Propositions = f(Facts)$$\n  $$Language = f(Reality)$$\n Now here things become interesting - so I suggest that absorb the basics and pre-requisites now and only proceed when you are comfortable with what has been written up till now.\nCore Analysis Wittgenstein is serious when he proclaims the independence of Facts and Objects. The independence stems from the following reasoning\n Objects are named. Facts are asserted. Therefore one cannot assert an object and cannot name Facts.\n Facts are composite units made up of individual atomic units which are indivisible - Wittgenstein calls these units as the atomic fact(hereafter fact compared to the composite Fact). The assertion of facts imputes a truth value to facts and thus propositions.\n For example - the fact is that there is a chessboard in my room which can be asserted via the proposition\n  There is a chessboard in my room - T/F [atomic fact]\n Objects and thus names are devoid of any truth-value/meaning/sense on their own apart from denotation.\n For example - tree denotes the object but is meaningless in isolation in all aspects but its reference - that is the meaning of a name is in the object it refers to\n So how are these two modes of Reality(reality) consistent in the single manifold? It is through the relation between facts and objects.\n Facts are combinations of objects[[3]]\n So what can we infer from the aforementioned axioms and definitions?\n The atomic fact is the simplest possible fact. An object is not a fact. facts are combination of objects.\n Thus there need to be at least two objects to constitute a fact.\nThe simplest possible fact(the atomic fact) deals with the fact of existence only. That is the atomic fact only contains of existential propositions, and if not then it would be a composite i.e. a Fact.\nFor example - There (exists) is a chessboard(o_1) in my room(o_2) or\n$$\\exists f = o_{1}o_{2} - True/False$$\nThus the set of all objects gives me the set of all possible facts and thus the set of all possible Facts. That is\n $$o_i\\in O\\implies \\Phi =(o_{i}o_{j}o_{k}\\cdots): i\\neq j\\neq k\\cdots \u0026amp; F\\in \\Phi$$ The set of all possible Facts determines the actual state of affairs in the world. That is facts determine the state of affairs - whether something is the case or not the case(The case is the existence of the fact that is a fact = T).Therefore All that is the case forms the world. facts in logical space(possible facts from given objects) constitute the world. Reality is the union of existence and non-existence of atomic facts $$R \\equiv \\cup([f:f=T].[f':f=F)$$ or $$\\cup(f.f')$$  As a preliminary, I will conclude the first part here. In the next part we will delve into the structure of language - syntax and semantics to analyze how we cognize relations in Reality projected from relations in reality/language and what it tells about us and the world. Thus we move into the realm of language first to capture Reality unlike this part where we mirrored a language from the realm of Reality - facts and objects. That is our main unit of analysis would now be Propositions from which we shall derive relations between\n propositions and thoughts propositions and images/pictures signs and symbols in language Natural language(empirical language) vs Logical language(language as a model of world)   It is to be mentioned that the first and last propositions are also the most quotable and quoted propositions of the entire work - and that is no coincidence. [↩︎]\nin philosophical circles known as Cartesian Dualism between mind and matter i.e. Subject and Object - The core structure of our natural languages. [↩︎]\nThink of it like this - facts are relativistic - a black ink mark on its own is an abstraction unless it is in a canvas/floor/paper. Due to our use of natural language, we forget that fact are always contextual and embedded in relation to something - I exist here it is understood that we have omitted the second object which is present in the form I exist(in the world) . Interestingly that is why it will be senseless to say This song is beautiful - because though there are two objects apparently, a particular song and the class of beautiful songs - the former is an object of substance, while the latter is not an object, unless it is the name of the song - beautiful by abc [↩︎]\n","date":"6 August, 2020","id":1,"permalink":"/posts/tlp1/","summary":"The Tractatus Logico Philosophicus tackles the fundamental concerns of philosophy, ranging from our perception of reality to ethical questions; from logic and language to mathematics and the mystical - all in a nested framework of seven propositions.","tags":"Linguistics Philosophy Wittgenstein Series","title":"Rational Mysticism - Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico Philosophicus - Part I"},{"content":" Living in the times of a pandemic is no longer a phase we have to simply wait over, rather, as we become accustomed to the circumstances prevailing, we’re now moving towards an equilibrium where such living becomes embedded in our psyche permanently, and consequently, becomes a permanent way of life.(Though surely, we are still in the infant stages of such a maturation and the future is ever uncertain)\nIn these state of affairs, an experiment of nature on us one might conceive, we can approach this discontinuity as a tool for a more abstract unity, of what remains unchanged in our mode of living, which are in the domain of philosophical speculation. Indeed, these events make philosophical abstraction easier with empirical validity, and the philosophical concept of interest, of which there has been a definite empirical discontinuity, but at the same time within the chain of the broader philosophical continuity is the Concept of experiencing time\nLike most of us, the initial stages of pandemic living threw me off-balance, and in response I sought some refuge in escapist fictional literature; particularly Thomas Mann’s - The Magic Mountain, which had been glaring at me from the bookshelf for two years.\nI deem even a brief plot summary to be irrelevant in the scope of this essay, for what I am to discuss deals with a few excerpts from the book discussing the notion of Time and Duration, which provoked my fascination in both applying the Philosophy of Henri Bergson1; and being relevant to the state of affairs we have found ourselves in.2\n Section 3 - Mental Gymnastic  The protagonist’s temperature is being taken, taking around seven minutes.\n A:- ’Seven minutes! But they must be up!’\nB:- ‘Yes, but when you watch it, the time, it goes very slowly. I quite like the measuring, four times a day; for then you know what a minute - or seven of them- actually amounts to, up here in this place, where the seven days of the week whisk by the way they do!’\nA:- ‘You say “actually”, but time isn’t actual. When it seems long to you, then it is long; when it seems short, why, then it is short. But how long or how short it actually is, that nobody knows.’\nB: - ‘How so? - we do measure it. We have watches and calendars for this purpose; and when a month is up, why, then up it is, for you and for me, and for all of us.’\nA:- ‘A minute is then as long as it seems to you when you measure yourself?’\nB:- ‘A minute is as long- it lasts as long- as it takes the second hand of my watch to complete a circuit.’\nA:- ‘But it takes a varied length of time for our senses. It is motion, isn’t it, motion in space? We measure time by space. How is that better than measuring space by time? Hamburg to Davos is twenty hours - that is, by train. On foot, how long is it? And in the mind, how long? Not a second. What is time? Space we perceive with our organs, senses of sight and touch.Good. But where is the organ of time? How can we measure something about which we know nothing. We say that ‘Time passes’. Sure, let it pass. But how does one measure that? We believe time flows evenly, with scientific precision, but does it? As far as our consciousness is considered, it does not - We only assume it does, for the sake of convenience; and our units of measurement are purely arbitrary, sheer conventions…’\nA much more nuanced take is taken up a few chapter later.\nSection 4 - Excursus on the Sense of Time;pp:100  There is after all , something peculiar about the process of habituating oneself in a new place, the often laborious fitting in and getting used to, which one undertakes for its own sake, and of set purpose to break it all off as soon as it is complete, or not long thereafter, and to return to one’s former state.\n  It is an interval, an interlude, inserted with the object of recreation, into the tenor of life’s main concerns; its purpose the relief of the organism, which is perpetually busy at its task of self-renewal, and which was in danger, almost in process, of being vitiated, slowed down, relaxed, by the bald, unjointed monotony of its daily course.\n  But what then is the cause of this relaxation, this slowing down that takes place when one does the same thing for too long at a time? It is not so much physical or mental fatigue or exhaustion, for if that were the case then complete rest would be the best restorative. It is rather something psychical; It means that the perception of time tends, through periods of unbroken uniformity, to fall away; the perception of time, so closely bound up with the consciousness of life that one may not be weakened without the other suffering a sensible impairment.\n  Many false conceptions are held concerning the nature of tedium. In general, it is thought that the interestingness and novelty of the time-content are what ‘make the time pass’; that is to say, shorten it; whereas monotony and emptiness check and restrain its flow.\n  This is only true with reservations. Vacuity, monotony, have, indeed the property of lingering out the moment and the hour and of making them tiresome. But they are capable of contracting and dissipating the larger, the very large time-units, to the point of reducing them to nothing at all.\n  And conversely, a full and interesting content can put wings to the hour and the day; yet it will lend to the general passage of time a weightiness, a breadth and solidity which cause the eventful years to flow far more slowly than those poor, bare, empty ones over which the wind passes and they are gone. Thus what we call tedium is rather an abnormal shortening of time consequent upon monotony.\n  Great spaces of time passed in unbroken uniformity tend to shrink together in a way to make the heart stop beating for fear; when one day is like all the others, then they are all like one; complete uniformity would make the longest life seem short, and as though it had stolen away from us unawares.\n  Habituation is a falling asleep or fatiguing of the sense of time; which explains why young years pass slowly, while later life flings itself faster and faster upon its course. We are aware that the intercalation of periods of change and novelty is the only means by which we can refresh our sense of time, strengthen, retard, rejuvenate it, and therewith renew our perception of life itself.\n  Such is the purpose of our changes of air and scene, of all our sojourns at cures and bathing resorts; it is the secret of the healing power of change and incident.\n  Our first days in a new place; time has a youthful, that is to say, a broad and a sweeping, flow, persisting for some six to eight days. Then, as one ‘gets used to the place’, a gradual shrinkage makes itself felt. He who clings or, better expressed, wishes to cling to life, will shudder to see how the days grow light and lighter, how they scurry by like dead leaves, until the last week, of some four, perhaps, is uncannily fugitive and fleet.\n  On the other hand, the quickening of the sense of time will flow out beyond the interval and reassert itself after the return to ordinary existence: the first days at home after the holiday will be lived with broader flow, freshly and youthfully - but only the first few, for one adjusts oneself more quickly to the rule than to the exception; and if the sense of time be already weakened by age, or - and this is a low sign of vitality - it was never really well developed, one drowses quickly back into the old life, and after four-and-twenty hours it is as though one had never been away, and the journey had been but a watch in the night.\n    Henri Bergson was a Nobel Prize winning philosopher who introduced radically new conceptions of Duration in particular.

It is very difficult for one to express what a psychedelic trip really is like, but one can at least try for standard highs at low or medium potencies. Even so, we are treated to an experience which has high chances of not being entirely pleasurable at the first instance. You see, what we dub as an altered state of consciousness basically means a sensory overload for which the brain hasn’t reformatted the experience for you, so as to say you experience a room or change the orientation of your bed and dazzling confusion, it’s phenomenological, a first experience of sorts where you forget the categories or they hide behind the active experience which suddenly forces itself into your frame, while at the same time your usual self sits like a passenger and tries to protect you by familiarising yourself, but sadly it only leads to a cognitive dissonance of your two halves trying to gain control, your usual self protecting you from seeing the world through new eyes and the new self which wants to let go but letting go of a child own a bicycle is not easy./ often go through a rite of passage\nA bad triu is differemt because it is not an uncomfortable trip. All bad trips are uncomfortable but not all uncomfortable trips are bad, though they might seem like so but you can only really tell in the aftermath/\nWhat someone tells you they had a bad trip, or the group began to have a bad trip or get tense. Then they removed themselves from the situation and went to play with some cats or played some video games or punched a cop or whatever fate they faced and everything was fine the next morning. For anyone who has never taken a hallucinogen, it sounds like a normal course of events that could occur during a night drinking, but I always feel like the \u0026lsquo;bad trip\u0026rsquo; part of it is never explained and the focus is on the aftermath.\nThe Experience You’re hanging out with friends, take a few hits. Nothing happens except for a weird sweet taste in your sticky mouth. Regardless, you continue talking and joking around as normal when wait, something feels different. You hear the guy next to you mention\n Dude, I’m totally buzzed\n With the obligatory\n Yeah Man! Totally.\n The conversations resume and you slightly shift your gaze towards your surroundings. Everything seems to have gained life, breathing and swaying like a wave, You question, “What are objects?” While this philosophy session is in full steam you notice a cat, No it’s a bag that looks like a cat. But what if it was a cat? What would you have done? You continue to think and start walking. Would that have been your cat from now on? Most probably! But that wall was definitely 6 inches farther away before and, wait now it\u0026rsquo;s back where it was. But what if it did move closer?.\nYou realise you are completely unprepared for the hypothetical situations presented by false reality. Then says something about the weather and all of a sudden it becomes unbearably hot. You are breathing magma. It is disgusting and you can taste the sulphur in the air and you think this is it. You are overheating and you are going to die. Then Jimmy says\u0026rsquo;Man, this is some good acid' and you think \u0026lsquo;Oh right\u0026hellip;acid. and you come back and you realize you\u0026rsquo;ve been jumping off the edge of the Super Mario Brothers map for 5 minutes? An hour? That\u0026rsquo;s when time slips. You can no longer tell a moment from an hour from a week.(Protip: Don\u0026rsquo;t check the time.) You are hit by what tripping-deathraygun has coined: violent confusion.\nIt comes in waves. Tripping is just handling one swell at a time as a thought or idea comes over you, you handle it the best you can, and move on to the next one. Sometimes the slatch brings you back to the sand underneath, and sometimes the wavelength shortens and and your toes never get a chance to touch ground.\nDuring one instance of touchdown you realize that you need to pee. You go to the bathroom. You\u0026rsquo;ve got this. You\u0026rsquo;ve done this before. You do your business and go to wash your hands. You look in the mirror. Who the fuck is that? Now, it can be a really informative moment of self reflection (ba dum..fuck it) or it can be one of the most horrifying experiences you\u0026rsquo;ve ever encountered. Every moment of your life comes into question. Every action you\u0026rsquo;ve ever taken is on the table. You question how you ended up in your bathroom on acid. You question who you are and why you act exactly as you do. Then you hear a knock. Jimmy goes, \u0026lsquo;Dude you\u0026rsquo;ve been in here forever you totally missed this thing with the ceiling.\nThe thing with the ceiling?\nYeah it was awesome.. there was this fly\u0026hellip; you missed it\u0026rsquo;\nYou go to rejoin the group and try to keep up while reflecting back to your alone time. When did John show up with the girl with the annoying laugh? Her laugh is like ice on your back and you want to be there as much as you want to be sitting in a room watching porn with your parents.\nYou think about watching porn with your parents. You think a little too hard about it. You shudder. You want to leave, but where are you going to go on a serious fucking drug? The bullshitting continues and you go back to thinking about who you are and what steps you took in life to end you up in a room with Jimmy and the guys and John and the annoying laugh girl. Why do these people hang out with me? Am l saying the right stuff? Am I being funny? Then Jimmy says something particularly retarded and you remember the acid and your toes touch sand.\nYou suggest the group go for a walk around campus. You decide to go barefoot, because fuck shoes. The world is beautiful and dark and the street lamps are glowing softly as they breathe and laugh girl is back at the apartment with John. The grass is cool and wet on your feet and everything is wonderful until Jimmy says the word swamp. Fucking Jimmy man. Suddenly it is hot as balls and your feet begin to sink into the field.\nYou feel like you\u0026rsquo;re fighting in fucking \u0026lsquo;nam as you see party-goers try and fornicate with each other while you\u0026rsquo;re sinking into the ground and trying to keep your head up.\nThe grass is no longer cool but trying to drag you into it. You come to your destination which is the middle of a field in the center of campus to watch the world go by as the heat sets in and you take off your shirt. Pants too, because fuck pants. It\u0026rsquo;s hot, they ll understand. And as to be referred to in the future by Jimmy as \u0026lsquo;that thing\u0026hellip; with the swamp\u0026rsquo; subsides and the wave lets you back down and your feet touch the sand, you realize you\u0026rsquo;re in your underwear in the middle of The Great Lawn at 1:30 AM on a Saturday night.Continue the night with Smash Brothers,jail, or cats as necessary.\nTLDR; Drugs are fun. But scary.\nEdit: Thank you for the r/bestofnomination and for the realization tha not the only psycho that goes through kind of thing. By popular request look fora good trip\u0026rsquo; piece in the very near future.
