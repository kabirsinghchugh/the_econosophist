It is human cognition that cognizes \u003cem\u003esubstance\u003c/em\u003e in ontological units - the default unit being objects.[[2]] That is, the World is made up of objects. Thus this is the metaphysical point of departure in Modern Metaphysics, ever since Immanuel Kant dismissed the \u003cem\u003eobject outside human cognition as fundamentally unknowable\u003c/em\u003e because our \u003cstrong\u003emind cognizes the manifold as objects in space, time and causal relations, which are not distinct absolute realities, rather the forms of intuition, or more accurately, the conditions which make sense objects intuitable in the first place.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWittgenstein here introduces a radical concept. While after Kant, there arose alternatives to \u003cem\u003eobject-oriented-ontology\u003c/em\u003e, such as \u003cem\u003eEvent-ontology\u003c/em\u003e(events as the unit of reality) or \u003cem\u003eProcess-Metaphysics\u003c/em\u003e(Processes as unit of reality), Wittgenstein incorporated two units of ontology \u003cstrong\u003ecoexisting simultaneously but independently of each other\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cem\u003ethink quantum theory where light is both a particle and a wave\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two fundamental units of Reality(once removed from the manifold) are composed of Facts and Objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne can see \u003cstrong\u003eR\u003c/strong\u003eeality in terms of \u003cstrong\u003eF\u003c/strong\u003eacts (I\u0026rsquo;ll explain what they are in detail, but a close analogy for now are \u003cem\u003eevents\u003c/em\u003e) \u003cstrong\u003eOR\u003c/strong\u003e Objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereality(not to be confused with \u003cstrong\u003eR\u003c/strong\u003eeality) is a function of \u003cstrong\u003eR\u003c/strong\u003eeality and thus \u003cem\u003etwice removed from the manifold\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ereality\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e is the structure/model of Reality (which is our raw data) and  \u003cem\u003econtains its ontological units as functions of Facts and Objects, as \u003cstrong\u003ePropositions\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eNames\u003c/strong\u003e respectively\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs one can guess, what Wittgenstein is getting to is that \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eR\u003c/strong\u003eeality is mirrored/modelled as reality through language.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is to say - \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLanguage mirrors Reality\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e - the consequence of which is that if we can analyze language through its \u003cem\u003esyntax/grammar\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003esemantics/meaning\u003c/em\u003e, we can analyze \u003cstrong\u003eR\u003c/strong\u003eeality.

It is not so much physical or mental fatigue or exhaustion, for if that were the case then complete rest would be the best restorative. It is rather something psychical; It means that the perception of time tends, through periods of unbroken uniformity, to fall away; the perception of time, so closely bound up with the consciousness of life that one may not be weakened without the other suffering a sensible impairment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany false conceptions are held concerning the nature of tedium.

Thus what we call tedium is rather an abnormal shortening of time consequent upon monotony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat spaces of time passed in unbroken uniformity tend to shrink together in a way to make the heart stop beating for fear; when one day is like all the others, then they are all like one; complete uniformity would make the longest life seem short, and as though it had stolen away from us unawares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHabituation is a falling asleep or fatiguing of the sense of time; which explains why young years pass slowly, while later life flings itself faster and faster upon its course. We are aware that the intercalation of periods of change and novelty is the only means by which we can refresh our sense of time, strengthen, retard, rejuvenate it, and therewith renew our perception of life itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch is the purpose of our changes of air and scene, of all our sojourns at cures and bathing resorts; it is the secret of the healing power of change and incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first days in a new place; time has a youthful, that is to say, a broad and a sweeping, flow, persisting for some six to eight days.
